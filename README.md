# House-Price-Prediction---ML-Project

This project predicts house sale prices using advanced machine learning models. It includes complete data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature selection, exploratory data analysis, model building, model evaluation. algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost were trained and evaluated, with XGBoost giving the best performance. The final model is used to generate predictions on the test dataset, and results are exported as a CSV file( Final_Predictions.csv).
