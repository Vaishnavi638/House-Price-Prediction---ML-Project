# House-Price-Prediction---ML-Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning and visualizing key insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The objective is to analyze housing data, identify important price-driving features, build a predictive model, and present meaningful business insights in a clear and interactive dashboard.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify important features affecting house prices

Build and evaluate a Machine Learning regression model

Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization

Provide actionable insights from housing data

🧠 Machine Learning Implementation

🔹 Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature selection

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (if applicable)

🔹 Model Used

Regression-based Machine Learning model
(e.g., Linear Regression / Random Forest / etc. – update according to your model)

🔹 Model Evaluation

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

The model predicts house prices based on features like:

Overall Quality

Living Area (GrLivArea)

Garage Area

Year Built

Lot Area

Neighborhood

House Style

And other structural attributes

📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview


The Power BI dashboard provides interactive insights including:

🔹 KPI Cards

Total Records: 1460

Important Features: 11

Average Sale Price: 180.92K

🔹 Visualizations Included

Sale Price by Overall Quality

Feature Importance Analysis

House Style Distribution

Sale Price vs:

Lot Area

Living Area

Garage Area

Year Built

Average Sale Price by Neighborhood

🔹 Filters (Slicers)

Overall Quality

House Style

Neighborhood

Year Built

This enables dynamic exploration of housing trends and pricing patterns.


📈 Key Insights


Houses with higher Overall Quality have significantly higher sale prices.

Living Area (GrLivArea) shows a strong positive correlation with Sale Price.

Newer houses tend to have higher selling prices.

Certain neighborhoods consistently show higher average sale prices.

Garage Area and Total Basement Area also contribute positively to pricing.
